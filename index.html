    <p>This is the first Brayden paragraph</p>
    <h3>Welcome!</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to my page!</br>
    </br>
      This is the main page to land on but there are many more to explore!</br>
      I plan to add stuff about me including but not limited to an overview and probably</br>
      a blog-style page where I put fun updates that are pseudo-professional pseudo-social.</br>
      I'm imagining it would be like linkedin if there wasn't that weirdly excessively-fake culture.</br>
      There will be silly and occasionaly strange pages where I am testing out different coding things,</br>
      so please click and have fun! I code this all myself with html and css so far, but I imagine</br>
      that javascript will be necessary eventually. We will take that road together tho!</br>
    </br>
      Thank you for taking the time to visit! It means so much to have others on this journey as well!
